# Big picture 
The project implements the Simplex method, a well-known algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Its objective is to iteratively modify a tableau and select entering and leaving variables to determine the optimal solution of the problem. Additionally, the project effectively deals with artificial variables and constraints using the two-phase method

# Advantages

1-Provides a practical implementation of the Simplex method for linear programming problems.

2-Handles cases with artificial variables and constraints through the two-phase method.

3-Allows users to input coefficients and constraints conveniently.

4-Prints the simplex tableau in a tabular format for better understanding.

5-Detects unbounded and infeasible solutions.

6-Supports finding alternative solutions, if they exist.
