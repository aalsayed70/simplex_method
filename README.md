# Big picture 
The project implements the Simplex method, a well-known algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Its objective is to iteratively modify a tableau and select entering and leaving variables to determine the optimal solution of the problem. Additionally, the project effectively deals with artificial variables and constraints using the two-phase method.
